# Introduction
My EE551 individual project is a pygame called Snake.
Designer: Zenglu Jiang

# Purposal
Through python, the project designed a classic and interesting puzzle game, Snake Eating. The game makes snakes grow longer and longer by controlling the direction of the snake's head to eat food. Every bite can get a certain score, and the longer the snake eats, the more difficult it will be to play. It can't touch the wall, bite its body, or bite its tail. After a certain score, it can pass the customs, and then continue to play the next pass.
